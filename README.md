# BankCSVReader
In big data environments, analysts are constantly writing ad hoc 
database queries to obtain general table statistics for purposes of 
validation, trend analysis, and to simply gain a deeper understanding of their data. 
Suppose we had a .CSV text file listing bank customers. Each line includes the customerâ€™s 
account number, name, marital status and account balance. The bank manager would like to know 
if customers with different marital status have, on average, significantly different account balances. 

In a programming language of your choice (or pseudocode), write or describe step-by-step a function that processes 
the .CSV file and outputs the average account balance for customers in each marital status category.
