/*In big data environments, analysts are constantly writing ad hoc database queries
to obtain general table statistics for purposes of validation, trend analysis, and to simply gain a deeper
understanding of their data. Suppose we had a .CSV text file listing bank customers. Each line includes
the customerâ€™s account number, name, marital status and account balance. The bank manager would
like to know if customers with different marital status have, on average, significantly different account
balances. In a programming language of your choice (or pseudocode), write or describe step-by-step a
function that processes the .CSV file and outputs the average account balance for customers in each
marital status category. */
